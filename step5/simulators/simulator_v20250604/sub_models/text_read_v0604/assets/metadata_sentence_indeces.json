Starting next month, 500 new bikes will be added to the fleet, and new docking stations will be installed across key areas. Launched three years ago, the program has seen significant growth, with daily ridership up by 20% in the past year. City officials believe the expansion will encourage more residents to bike rather than drive, especially for short trips. The new bikes have GPS tracking and improved safety features, including reflective strips and better lighting. Additionally, the city will launch a public awareness campaign to promote safe biking practices, including workshops and free helmets. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and pollution while promoting a healthier lifestyle. With these initiatives, the city hopes to lead in sustainable urban transportation.",

One change was establishing tech-free zones in my home, like the bedroom and dining area, which has improved my sleep and presence during meals.

Before each trip, I list essentials, focusing on versatile clothing and multipurpose items. This allows me to pack everything into a single carry-on, avoiding the hassle of checked luggage and making it easier to navigate airports and cities. Traveling light encourages a mindful experience. With fewer possessions to worry about, I can fully immerse myself in the destination, appreciating the culture and scenery without distractions.
