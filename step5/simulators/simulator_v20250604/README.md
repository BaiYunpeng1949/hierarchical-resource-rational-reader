# Time-Pressure Reading Simulator

This simulator extends the models from previous sections to incorporate time-perception abilities for reading under time pressure scenarios.

## Overview

The simulator builds upon the base reading models and adds time-pressure specific components:
- Time perception mechanisms
- Reading speed adaptation
- Time constraint handling
- Performance metrics under different time conditions

## Structure

- `models/`: Contains the time-pressure adapted model architectures
- `training/`: Scripts for training the time-pressure models
- `evaluation/`: Tools for evaluating model performance under different time constraints
- `configs/`: Configuration files for different time-pressure scenarios

## Workflow

1. **Model Extension**: Base reading models are extended with time-perception capabilities
2. **Training**: Models are trained separately with time-pressure specific objectives
3. **Freezing**: Trained models are frozen and prepared for simulation
4. **Simulation**: Frozen models are used in the main simulator for time-pressure reading experiments
